As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.",

In turn, we project the impact of social distancing and school closure on COVID-19 transmission.",

Shanghai experienced extensive importation of COVID-19 cases from Wuhan as well as local transmission (3) . The surveys were conducted from February 1, 2020 to February 10, 2020, as transmission of COVID-19 peaked across China and stringent interventions were in place. Participants in Wuhan were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their contact behavior (4, 5) on two different days: i) a regular weekday between December 24, 2020 and December 30, 2020, before the COVID-19 outbreak was officially recognized by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (used as baseline); and ii) the day before the interview (outbreak period). A similar survey was conducted in Shanghai to obtain information on contacts during the COVID-19 outbreak period; contacts for the baseline period were based on a survey using the same design conducted in the same city in 2017-2018 (6) . Details are given in the Supplementary Material.",
